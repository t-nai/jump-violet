# jump-violet

**To run this program, download all files in the main branch. Run the command 'pip install pygame' in your Python software's terminal. Ensure all downloaded files are in the same folder as the main.py file, and then run to play the game. Happy jumping!**

**Inspiration**\
We wanted to create a game that would help teach younger girls about women in computing! We also wanted to see a character in a game that looked like us, so the main character named Violet is in a HackViolet shirt.

**What it does**\
This game is similar to the popular Flappy Bird game. However, our game has a girl traveling through a timeline of important historical discoveries or achievements made by women in computing.

**How we built it**\
We built this program entirely from scratch. We used Python to code the program that runs this. We also hand-drew all of the game graphics (with the exception of the HackViolet logo in the background).

**Challenges we ran into**\
We did not have a lot of experience with the pygame library, so we spent a lot of time figuring out how certain commands worked (and why they were not working for us). Eventually, with a lot debugging, we figured it out!

**Accomplishments that we're proud of**\
The game we designed was the first time we both worked on a coding project for fun outside of the classroom setting. We are first-time hackers, and this entire project was an exciting challenge. We are most proud of the fact we made this all from scratch (with the help of the pygame library). It is so cool to see our idea come to life in a functioning game!

**What we learned**\
We learned a lot about making games in Python. The different libraries, functionalities, and debugging methods were all pretty-much new to us and very valuable to understand.

**What's next for Jump, Violet!**\
We would like to make this game reach younger girls so that they can learn about the history of women in computing. Seeing the achievements that have been made by women would help them see that there is a welcoming place for them in Computer Science and hacking. It also empowers young women by showing them how creative and interactive coding can be!
